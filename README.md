Kubevol allows you to audit all your Kubernetes pods for an attached volume or see all the volumes attached to each pod by a specific type (eg: ConfigMap, Secret).

Features:

- Query for ConfigMaps and Secrets (future support coming for other types of volumes)
- Kubernetes controller to watch and record changes to ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Filter by namespace
- Filter by a specific object name
- See if attached volume has a stale version attached

## Installation

You can download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/bmaynard/kubevol/releases).

## Watch And Record Changes

Since Kubernetes doesn't keep track of when a `Secret` or `Configmap` was updated, `kubevol` has a Kubernetes controller that will watch for all changes and will record the last modified date. This then gives `kubevol` the ability to detect if an attached `Secret` or `Configmap` is outdated. 

To install the watch controller, run:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmaynard/kubevol/main/deployment/manifest.yaml
```

### Configuration

If your kubeconfig is not in the default location in your home directory, you can specify a custom kubeconfig file by creating the following file:

`~/.kubevol.yaml`
```
---
kubeconfig: /path/to/kube/config
```

## Sample Output

```
$ kubevol secret
There are 12 pods in the cluster
Searching for pods that have a Secret attached
